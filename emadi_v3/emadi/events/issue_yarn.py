# "Issue Yarn" button on Weaving Contract (submitted only) - "same workflow
# like issue fabric in dyeing contract is needed in Weaving Contract ...
# user will enter qty of each yarn mentioned in weaving contract in the
# popup, same material transfer entry will be opened, user will submit the
# entry himself, same sales order and weaving contract reference will be
# mentioned in stock entry" (your words). Mirrors Dyeing Contract's
# issue_fabric()/apply_issued_qty()/reverse_issued_qty() almost exactly -
# see mjfsd_v3/events/issue_fabric.py - with two differences:
#
# 1. Rows are BOM Items (one per yarn), not Dyeing Contract Items - the
#    qty issued/remaining is tracked in Lbs against `yarn_qty` (your
#    choice when asked - Yarn Qty (Lbs), not Required Bags), in a new
#    `yarn_issued` custom field (see custom/bom_items.json).
#
# 2. Source/Target Warehouse are fixed, not read off the contract or asked
#    in the popup (your answer when asked): always "Source - PT" ->
#    "Supplier - PT". Validated to actually exist before building the
#    Stock Entry, so a typo'd/renamed warehouse throws a clear error
#    instead of a confusing one lower down in ERPNext's own stock code.
#
# Built the accumulator (yarn_issued) as self-healing from day one -
# sync_yarn_issued_totals() below queries actually-submitted Stock Entries
# directly, the same fix that had to be retrofitted onto Dyeing Contract's
# Issued Qty after its on_submit hooks.py wiring couldn't be confirmed
# (see claude/dyeing-workflow.md, 2026-09-16 follow-up). No separate
# on_submit/on_cancel hooks.py entries needed for this one at all.
