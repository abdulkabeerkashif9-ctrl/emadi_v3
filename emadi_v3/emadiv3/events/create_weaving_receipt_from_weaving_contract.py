# "Weaving Receipt" button on Weaving Contract (shown only when Type =
# External). Builds an unsaved Weaving Receipt with one Items row
# prefilled from this contract - reuses the exact same row shape as
# mjfsd_v3's own get_weaving_contract_items() (the "Get Items From > Weaving
# Contract" popup already on Weaving Receipt itself), so both paths stay
# consistent. Returns the unsaved doc for the browser to route to
# (frappe.model.sync + frappe.set_route) - does NOT insert or submit
# anything, matching this project's "prefill, open the form, let the user
# review and save" pattern for buttons that create a new document.
#
# 2026-09-28 fix - "weaving receipt is still asking for weaver ... when it
# is already mentioned in Weaving Contract. Also, Source and Target
# warehouse is also empty" (your words). This button never went through
# weaving_receipt.js's own "Get Items From" dialog (that's what sets
# Weaver + locks it, on the OTHER path into Weaving Receipt) - it only
# ever appended the Items row and returned. Weaver, Source Warehouse and
# Target Warehouse were never set on the header at all here, which is why
# they came back empty/required no matter what the Weaving Contract had.
# Fixed to set all three explicitly, same fixed-warehouse pattern as
# issue_yarn.py's own SOURCE_WAREHOUSE/TARGET_WAREHOUSE (validated to
# actually exist first, so a typo'd/renamed warehouse throws a clear
# error here too instead of failing confusingly on save).
#
# Also stopped dumping the row's "weaver" key straight into the Items
# child row - Weaving Receipt Item has no such field (it's header-only),
# so it was just a harmless but meaningless extra attribute on the child
# doc; now popped off and used to set the header field instead.

SOURCE_WAREHOUSE = "Supplier - PT"
TARGET_WAREHOUSE = "Finished Goods - PT"
