# 2026-09-28 - "In Material Transfer of Issue Yarn from Weaving Contract,
# create a field of Weaver (Linked to supplier, fetch from weaving
# contract), Weaving Contract Ref ..., Driver Name (Linked to Driver
# Doctype), Vehicle No (Linked to Vehicle Doctype) and Remarks (Data)"
# (your words).
#
# Stock Entry already has "weaver" (Link Customer - wrong target, fixed
# below), "weaving_contract" (already correct), "driver_name" and
# "vehicle_no" (both plain Data - now converted to Link) from emadi_v3 and
# mjfsd_v3's existing custom/stock_entry.json fixtures. Rather than trust
# that fixture-sync (already shown unreliable on this bench - see the
# Weaving Contract layout / Sales Order Item GSM fixes) to pick up these
# changes, this force-creates/updates them directly via Frappe's Custom
# Field API, same pattern as garments_app_v3's
# force_create_v3_custom_fields patch. Safe to re-run (update=True).
#
# Depends on the standard ERPNext Driver and Vehicle doctypes being
# installed (HR / Fleet Management) - if your bench doesn't have them,
# tell me and I'll point Driver Name / Vehicle No at something else.
